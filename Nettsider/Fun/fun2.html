        <p>
            The capital of Oslo is one of Europe’s fastest-growing
            cities. International media is constantly writing about
            Oslo’s innovative architecture, museums, and neighbourhoods,
            as well as everything that moves on the food, fashion, art,
            and music scenes. Over the last few years, several new quarters
            have been established in the city centre, with exciting new
            activities and attractions. The high-rise buildings in
            Barcode and captivating landmarks like the Opera House
            and the Astrup Fearnley museum are changing the face of '
            the city, and will soon be accompanied by a new Munch
            Museum and the new National Museum.
