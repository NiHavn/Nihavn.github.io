      <h2>About Oslo</h2>
      <p>
        The capital, Oslo is one of Europe’s fastest-growing cities.
        International media is constantly writing about Oslo’s innovative
        architecture, museums, and neighbourhoods, as well as everything that
        moves on the food, fashion, art, and music scenes. Over the last few
        years, several new quarters have been established in the city centre,
        with exciting new activities and attractions. The high-rise buildings in
        Barcode and captivating landmarks like the Opera House and the Astrup
        Fearnley museum are changing the face of ' the city, and will soon be
        accompanied by a new Munch Museum and the new National Museum.

      <h2>The opera building</h2>
      <p>
        The Oslo Opera House is the home of the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, and the national opera theatre in Norway. 
        The building is situated in the Bjørvika neighbourhood of central Oslo, at the head of the Oslofjord.
        The roof of the building angles to ground level, creating a large plaza that invites pedestrians to walk up and enjoy the panoramic views of Oslo.
        While much of the building is covered in white granite and La Facciata, a white Italian carrara marble, the stage tower is clad in white aluminium, in a design by Løvaas & Wagle that evokes old weaving patterns.
