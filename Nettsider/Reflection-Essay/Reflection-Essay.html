Reflection-essay: This page must contain a short text (500-700 words)
describing the challenges experienced by the (one, several or all)
members of the group when transitioning from upper-secondary school
(or work-life) to university. Reflect on any of the following topics:
a) learning to code, or
b) being a student rather than a pupil, or
c) managing the workload.

Please illustrate with screenshots of code or illustrating images if you
can. Else, we recommend using images of OsloMet to create a mix of
headings, paragraphs, and images for this page. We shall not assess the
language/grammar of the paragraphs. We expect headings, text and
images that relate to each other (content). Headings should be
informative and grammatically correct (proper visual hierarchy).

                    which assists you in understanding and implementing code. The major benefit of stackoverflow is the ability
                    to find solutions in not only HTML / CSS / Javascript, but virtually any programming language that is out
                    there. </span>
                     Simply google your problem and find a vast amount of explanations in order to assist you in understanding the code. Additionally, staying active in stack-overflow is a great way to expand your portfolio!

                        The biggest change that an incoming student will have to adapt to is the schedule. Although showing up is no longer mandatory, it is so incredibly important that a student shows up to lectures and seminars. The pacing of university syllabuses far exceed gynmnasium syllabuses and keeping a steady progress of your work is key to academic performance.
                    </span>
                    It may sound tempting to simply drop the classes and seminars due to a lack of obligation, but this however, will likely lead to academic struggles. Manage your time efficiently and keep a close watch of your time schedule. It will frequently be updated in case a class is moved to another building or maybe postponed.
